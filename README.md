(Unsuccessful) attempt at building a generative chatbot

A first attempt at building a generative chatbot using dialogue from the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus. The code is largely adapated from Codecademy's "Build a Chatbot using 
Python" course. 

For some reason, the chatbot doesn't generate new responses, but returns the same one each time.
